FAT32 Reader
This Java program allows users to interactively browse and inspect the contents of a FAT32-formatted disk image. It reads filesystem metadata, navigates directory structures, and displays or extracts information about files.

Once running, you can enter commands in a shell-like prompt:

/] INFO

/] LS

/] STAT MYFILE.TXT

/] SIZE README.TXT

/] CD DOCS

/] READ MYFILE.TXT 0 100

/] STOP
